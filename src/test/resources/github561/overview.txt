New Horizons MVIC Calibration Reference Files - Overview
========================================================

Content
-------
This collection contains ancillary files used in the calibration of data 
from the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) instrument for all
phases of the New Horizons primary and extended missions.

These files are not the result of MVIC observations. They consist of
filter transmittance curves, reference spectra from the literature, 
flat fields, and similar products derived from the literature, 
ground testing, and so on.

Some products appear in multiple versions as a result of improvements
in calibration algorithms and pipline processing over the course of 
the missions. For these product lines, the calibrated data will reference
the specific version of the product in this collection that was used in
its production. So while some of these files were "superseded" in terms
of what was used in later versions of the pipeline, they are not 
"superseded" in an archival sense because they are applicable to the
data produced using them.

The provenance for each ancillary file, as far as it is could be determined,
is included in the label for each product. The files were presumably 
collected by the MVIC team, but no attribution was provided in the PDS3 
data. The PDS4 migration was performed by SBN personnel, who are credited as 
editor of this collection.

PDS3 to PDS4 Migration Notes
----------------------------
The PDS3 versions of these calibration files were duplicated cumulatively 
in every MVIC PDS3 dataset archived. For the migrated PDS4 archive, only
a single instance of each version of each file was retained. Errors 
associated with flat fields but provided in separate files are included as 
part of the PDS4 flat field product, where they exist. 
                    
In addition, references were tracked down, DOIs added, and provenance 
information supplied (where it could be found) for each of the files in
this collection. The PDS3 labels, which contained minimal metadata beyond
data structure, were not retained in the migrated PDS4 archive but are 
accessible in archival copies of the PDS3 datasets retained in the NSSDCA
deep archive.
