1998_1378,1998_1378-21,The visible surface of Half Anvil looks rough with pits and knobs of cm size thus resembling surface of neighboring rock Ovoid.
1998_1378,1998_1378-22,"On flat horizontal top of Half Anvil, which looks relatively bright probably due to presence of bright fine material, there are three dark knobs, each about 3#cm across, looking as small rock fragments."

1998_1462,1998_1462-2,"The Mermaid ""dune""  deposit  also may be fluvial because it is poorly sorted with a small cohesion and large friction angle."
1998_1462,1998_1462-3,"The dark surfaces of Mermaid may result from an eolian lag deposit of sands and granules of rock too large for wind entrainment [2] which is consistent with the modestly larger silica content (50%) of the lag surface (A-15) compared with the three other ""soils"" above [4]."
1998_1462,1998_1462-4,"Other positive features, such as Ender and Mini-Matterhorn, may be more cohesive phases of fluvial deposits because they also appear to be soil-like."

2002_1771,2002_1771-12,"327 Conclusions: We conclude that the Eastern facet of Yogi, which faces into the mean wind direction, is substantially more blue (less red) than the orthogonal (Southern) facet."
2002_1771,2002_1771-13,The method we applied to Yogi can be performed quickly and provides an efficient way to produce spectral products which are independent of illumination conditions.
2002_1771,2002_1771-14,Plans:  The method we used to interpret the color of Yogi still has the simplification of not accounting for the wavelength-dependant scattering phase function of the surface.

2002_1775,2002_1775-0,"These materials included ""Black Rock"" cobbles and pebbles similar to those first identified by [13] and having 1000 nm band minima at a wavelength longer than that of the IMP bandpass, ""Intermediate Soil"" of a possibly indurated or compacted nature, exhibiting a deeper 900 nm absorption band than normal Bright Soil [14], and ""Spotted"" patches on the rock called Desert Princess, exhibiting a distinct 900 nm band and higher reflectances at 671 through 802 nm than other units [14]."
2002_1775,2002_1775-1,"The ""spotted"" patches on Desert Princess could be vesicles filled with altered soil or dust, cobbles in a conglomerate rock, or perhaps even phenocrysts of differing composition."

2002_1947,2002_1947-0,"We already know that the effect of the illumination can, under some conditions, be quite large: for example the side of Yogi that appeared overly red under noon illumination in the Gallery Pan [3]."
2003_1081,2003_1081-0,We use four highly diverse IMP images centered on Mini-Matterhorn and the Rock Garden because they are suited to demonstrate the wide morphologic variation of rocks at the site.
