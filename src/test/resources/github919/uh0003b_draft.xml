                        A binary table with spacecraft HGA pointing data from the Voyager 2 encounter 
                        with Uranus.  Each record comprises 18 fields each with a Univac 72-bit floating 
                        point one's complement value. The first 36 bits and the last 684 bits of each
                        record are undefined. Record 3188 contains zeros and is not part of this table
                        specification.  Angles are in degrees; unit vectors are in the EME 50 spacecraft 
                        centered copordinate system.
                        NB: The descriptions below are based on the best available documentation; but 
                        they include easily recognized errors. For analysis, HGA pointing during the 
                        Uranus occultation should be obtained from NAIF SPICE kernels.  This file is
                        included primarily for its historic value.

                                                 (SCET) in seconds from 1950.0. This field of 11 bits contains
                                                 the exponent (EXP) for the SCET value.  The exponent is biased  
                                                 by 1024; after removing the bias, the result is used to create
                                                 the factor 2**(EXP-1024).  Hexadecimal values in this field
                                                 are expected to be "41F" (binary 10000011111, decimal 1055).

                                                 seconds from 1950.0 (or 1986-01-24T18:55:00 at the spacecraft).

                                                 boresight unit vector. These 60 bits contain the mantissa for 
                                                 that component.  The first bit in the mantissa is the bit 
                                                 representing 2**-1, the second is the bit representing 2**-2, 
                                                 etc. The corresponding value is the product of the exponent

                                                 the mantissa for that component.  The first bit in the mantissa 
                                                 is the bit representing 2**-1, the second is the bit 
                                                 representing 2**-2, etc. The corresponding value is the product
                                                 of the exponent factor 2**(EXP-1024) and the mantissa with the

                                                 The eighteenth quantity in the record is the z-component of the
                                                 unit vector from the spacecraft to Uranus. These 11 bits contain
                                                 the exponent for that component. The exponent is biased by 1024;
                                                 after removing the bias, the result is used to create the 
                                                 factor 2**(EXP-1024).

                                                 unit vector from the spacecraft to Uranus. These 60 bits contain
                                                 the mantissa for that component.  The first bit in the mantissa 
                                                 is the bit representing 2**-1, the second is the bit 
                                                 representing 2**-2, etc. The corresponding value is the product
                                                 of the exponent factor 2**(EXP-1024) and the mantissa with the 
                                                 appropriate sign attached.
