   trans. Israel Program for Scientific Translations, NASA TT F-80 /          
   OTS 62-11031.                                                              
                                                                              
   The original publication ran approximately 600 pages and included          
   a table titled "Catalogue of Absolute Magnitudes" which comprises          
   the data in this data set; plus a second, far more extensive               
   table called "Observations and Physical Characteristics".  The             
   second table was not included in the English translation used to           
   prepare these files.  There are no head diameters or tail lengths          
   listed in the Absolute Magnitude table; thus no record from                
   this reference is included in the "pccds.tab" file.                        
                                                                              
   The description of the table values in this reference indicates that       
   the quality of the H10 values is given on the following scale:             
                                                                              
        1   possible error of up to 1 magnitude                               
        2   error does not exceed 0.4 - 0.6 magnitudes                        
        3   error within 0.1 - 0.2 magnitudes

   This article continues the compilation begun in the 1964 book.             
   Updated parameters are included for those comets from the first            
   publication which were further observed, in addition to the new            
   comets listed.  Head diameters and tail lengths are included in            
   this and all subsequent publications.  H10 quality codes and tail          
   visibility indicators are also included in this article.

   H10 quality codes are included, but from this point forward none           
   of the publications include the tail visibility flags.  Included           
   in the article are notes concerning the individual observations            
   and objects.

        1   possible error of order 1 magnitude

        3   error is less than 0.1 magnitudes

   This article was completely superceded by the next publication.  There     
   were no comets listed here which were not also listed in the 1974          
   reference.  Since the present data set was compiled only from the latest   
   available data for each object, there are no records originating from      
   the table in this article.  It is included here for completeness, and      
   because it is the last of the series available in an English translation.  
   (The notes regarding objects and observations found in most of the other   
   articles are not present here.)

   Neither H10 quality codes nor tail visibility indicators are               
   included in this publication, nor are tail type indicators.

   This publication includes neither H10 quality codes or tail                
   visibility indicators, but it does include the tail type flags             
   which have been incorporated into the "pccds.tab" file.  Also              
   included are extensive notes about the individual observations.
