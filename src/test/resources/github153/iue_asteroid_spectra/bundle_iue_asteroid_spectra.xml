      <description>-In this archive we create a one-stop shop of ultraviolet (UV) data of asteroids for
easy use by planetary scientists. Currently several of the existing UV datasets are
not in the PDS and are unavailable for scientific use by the broad community; others
are available only in their raw form. Because UV wavelengths deliver critical access
to the uppermost layers of the regoliths of these airless bodies, and can often offer
unique compositional information, providing these data in one location will allow for
comparative studies over wider ranges of wavelengths, studies of compositional and
space weathering effects throughout the solar system, and the often numerous
observations of each body will allow for the study of possible temporal and spatial
variability. This archive includes derived International Ultraviolet Observer (IUE)
reflectance spectra for five asteroid targets.</description>

    <description>-The raw IUE data used in this study were obtained from the INES (IUE Newly Extracted
Spectra) Web site. The NEWSIPS versions of these spectra have been published were
published by Roettger &amp; Buratti (1994). The INES files benefit from an improved
geometric correction, a more accurate photometric correction, and an increased
signal-to-noise ratio of the extracted IUE data through the use of new processing
algorithms (Wamsteker &amp; Gonzelez-Riestra 1998). Spectra were taken with the Long
Wavelength Redundant (LWR) spectrograph, which covers the 185-335 nm wavelength range
with a spectral spacing of 0.27 nm. 
To determine the reflectance measured in the IUE observations, we used the equations
outlined by Hendrix and Vilas (2006). we converted the spectra to photons cm-2 s-1
Angstrom-1 for division by the solar spectrum. For all observations we used a solar
spectrum from UARS SOLSTICE (Rottman et al. 1993), corrected to an Earth-Sun distance
of 1.0 AU. The observations were corrected for satellite-Sun and satellite-Earth
distances at the time of each measurement. 
The archive includes individual reflectance spectra for each observation, along with
average spectra where multiple observations at similar phase angles exist. The
archive also includes thumbnail plots of reflectance spectra, and the original IUE
header files.
