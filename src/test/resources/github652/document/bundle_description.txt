=====================================================================================

This
bundle archives data for near-Sun asteroids using Lowell Observatory's
4.3-m
Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT; formerly known as the Discovery
Channel
Telescope, DCT) and the 4.1-m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)
telescope,
supplemented by data from the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and
Lowell
Observatory's 42-in and 31-in telescopes between 2017 January and 2020
March.
Data in this bundle was used in a Planetary Science Journal publication,
Holt et
al. 2022. A detailed description is given in the 
archivedescription.pdf in the
document directory.
