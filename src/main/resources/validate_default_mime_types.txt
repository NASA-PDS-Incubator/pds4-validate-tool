# This file contains a mime type and the file extensions.
# It is used by validate to get the mime type based on file extension.
#
# comments begin with a '#'
# the format is <mime type> <space separated file extensions>
# for example:
text/plain    txt text TXT TEXT
# this would map file.txt, file.text, and file.TXT to
# the mime type "text/plain"
#
# The left token has replaced spaces ' ' with underscore '_' since it would be confusing.
# The code that uses this must convert spaces ' ' to underscore '_' to match with the mime type returned.
