# üö¢¬†Dockerfile

There's one Dockerfile here that can be used to make images for development and production.

To build an image, run:

    docker image build --build-arg tar_file=URL --tag [OWNER/]registry-api-service:TAG .

Replace `URL` with the URL (or relative file path) to a `validate` TAR file and `TAG` with the desired version tag. You can add `OWNER/` to tag the image for a specific owner, such as `nasapds/`.

The GitHub Actions configured in this repository automatically make images after each `stable-cicd.yaml` workflow (with a `:X.Y.Z` tag) and `unstable-cicd.yaml` workflow (with a `:latest` tag) and publishes them to the Docker Hub.


## üß±¬†Example Builds

Building a local image:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/NASA-PDS/validate.git
$ cd validate
$ mvn package
$ docker image build --build-arg tar_file=target/*-bin.tar.gz --tag validate:latest --file docker/Dockerfile .
```

Building an image from a released jar file:
```console
$ docker image build --build-arg tar_file=https://github.com/NASA-PDS/validate/releases/download/v1.0.0/validate-1.0.0-bin.tar.gz --tag nasapds/validate:1.0.0 --file docker/Dockerfile .
```


## üèÉ Steps to run a docker container of the Validate Tool

The [Operation documentation](https://nasa-pds.github.io/validate/operate/index.html) of the Validate 
tool provides a detailed guide on executing the Validate Tool.

The same commandline arguments can be used to execute the docker container of the Validate Tool with 
the following docker specific change.

- Docker containers cannot directly see the files and directories in the host machine. Therefore, it is required to map 
the files and directories as volumes, so the docker container can access them.
- Read more about docker volumes at https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/ 

For example:

A PDS bundle can be validated with Validate Tool as follows as per the 
[Operation documentation](https://nasa-pds.github.io/validate/operate/index.html) of the Validate tool.

```shell
% validate $HOME/pds/bundle -M checksum-manifest.txt -r validate-report.txt -R pds4.bundle
```

However, when using the dockerized Validate Tool, above command can be updated as follows.

```shell
docker container run \
                 --rm \
                 --volume "${HOME}/pds/bundle":/tmp/pds \
                 --volume "${HOME}/pds/bundle/checksum-manifest.txt":/tmp/pds/checksum-manifest.txt \
                 --volume "${HOME}/validate-report":/tmp/validate-report \
                 nasapds/validate /tmp/pds -M /tmp/pds/checksum-manifest.txt -r /tmp/validate-report/validate-report.txt -R pds4.bundle
```


## üèÉ Steps to execute the run.sh with default arguments

An example shell script called `run.sh` is provided in the docker directory of Validate repository. 
This script provides an easier way execute the dockerized Validate Tool to validate a PDS bundle with default arguments. 
It is possible to make copies of this `run.sh` script, modify the default arguments and execute those 
scripts as a simplified shell script based option.

1. To use the `run.sh`, update the following environment variables (if necessary) in the `run.sh`.


| Variable                    | Description |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| PDS_BUNDLE_PATH             | PDS bundle directory location in the host machine, which is used to execute the dockerized Validate Tool |
| CHECKSUM_MANIFEST_FILE_NAME | Checksum file name provided for the PDS bundle |
| VALIDATE_REPORT_PATH        | Validate report directory path |
| VALIDATE_REPORT_FILE_NAME   | Validate report file name |
| DEFAULT_ARGS                | Default arguments provided as an array. This can be updated based on the requirements. |

```    
# Update following environment variable to match with your environment

# PDS bundle directory location in the host machine, which is used to execute the dockerized Validate Tool
PDS_BUNDLE_PATH=${HOME}/urn-nasa-pds-insight_rad

# Checksum file name provided for the PDS bundle
CHECKSUM_MANIFEST_FILE_NAME=urn-nasa-pds-insight_rad.md5

# Validate report directory path
VALIDATE_REPORT_PATH=${HOME}

# Validate report file name
VALIDATE_REPORT_FILE_NAME=validate-report.txt

# Default arguments provided as an array. This can be updated based on the requirements.
DEFAULT_ARGS=(/tmp/pds -M /tmp/pds/${CHECKSUM_MANIFEST_FILE_NAME} -r /tmp/validate-report/${VALIDATE_REPORT_FILE_NAME} -R pds4.bundle)

```

2. Open a terminal and change the current working directory to `validate/docker`.

3. If executing for the first time, change the execution permissions of `run.sh` file as follows.

```
chmod u+x run.sh
```

4. Execute the `run.sh` as follows.

```
./run.sh
```

Above steps will execute a docker container of the Validate Tool with default arguments provided in 
the `run.sh` file.
